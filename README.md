# cmcm-skel

In 2016 I've stumbled upon haskell-vim-now and quite amused I was. I actually  
do rarely code in Haskell in comparison to doing system administration, but  
the need for a portable and comfortable environment is real. So I decided to  
rip off the haskell-vim-now project of its' files, gruesomely (is it even a  
word?) mutilate them, pepper with some other config files and voi la, the  
abomination is making it first baby steps, how cute.

As for now this project has no practical use for other people, but the idea of  
decoupling the Haskell dev-env and productive terminal experience seems  
promising. So _probably_ I will try to transform it into something like a soil  
on which haskell-vim-now could be painlessly planted if needed.
